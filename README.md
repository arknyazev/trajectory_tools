# Trajectory Tools

A Python package for analyzing particle trajectories calculated using the orbit-resonance branch of SIMSOPT. This package provides utilities for classifying and analyzing trapped and passing particle trajectories in stellarator magnetic fields.

## Description

This package contains tools for working with particle trajectory data generated by [SIMSOPT's orbit-resonance branch](https://github.com/arknyazev/simsopt/tree/orbit_resonance_minimal). It helps analyze particle confinement properties in stellarator magnetic fields, such as classification of trapped and passing particles.
